## gfbuild-angle is a set of scripts for building [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle) for the GraphicsFuzz project

[GraphicsFuzz](https://github.com/google/graphicsfuzz) is a set of tools for automatically finding bugs in graphics shader compilers. GraphicsFuzz invokes libraries and command line tools from other projects written in C++. These projects must be built in a specific and consistent way for Linux, Mac, and Windows, and the binaries must be released continuously and independently with each change, far more frequently than with a typical stable release schedule.

This is not an officially supported Google product.
